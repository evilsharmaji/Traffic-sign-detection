# ðŸš¦ Traffic Sign Detection - Data Annotation Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates image annotation for a real-world computer vision problem: traffic sign detection. I used Roboflow to label 30+ images of various road signs and exported the dataset in YOLOv5 format.

## Tools Used
- Roboflow (image annotation)
- Bounding box labeling
- Dataset export in YOLOv5 format

## Labels Used
- Stop Sign
- Speed Limit
- Yield Sign
- No Entry

## Dataset
Images sourced from Roboflow Universe: [Traffic Sign Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/traffic-sign-detection-vngbh/traffic-sign-detection-jgti0/dataset/1/download)

## Folder Structure
- `/images` - Input traffic sign images
- `/labels` - Annotation files in YOLO format
- `/screenshots` - Annotation proof


## ðŸ“ˆ Purpose & Applications
Traffic sign detection plays a vital role in autonomous vehicles, smart surveillance, and urban mobility systems. This project lays the groundwork for creating robust AI models by preparing accurate, clean labeled datasets.

## ðŸ“Œ What's Next?
- Training a YOLOv5 model using this dataset
- Exploring automated annotation tools with AI-assisted labeling
- Contributing to open datasets for smart city solutions
